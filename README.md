Student Directory
=======================

## Synopsis

My very first coding project, written during Week 1 of Makers Academy. What a long way I've come!

This programme allows to enter and list all the students of my cohort at Makers Academy in the Terminal. I've intentionnally left it as it was on that first week, to showcase the progress I have made since then.

- Then pick 1 to input a couple of students - imaginary or real
- Then pick 2 to display them in the Terminal
- Finally 9 to Exit
